# Meme Feed Improvements

## âœ… Implemented

### 1. **Chronological Sorting** 
- Memes now display in descending order by `createdAt` (newest first)
- Each new meme is inserted and list is re-sorted automatically
- Provides natural, time-based feed experience

### 2. **Loading Spinner**
- Shows `CircularProgressIndicator` while fetching initial memes
- Spinner disappears once first meme is received
- Provides clear UX feedback during network fetch

### 3. **Pull-to-Refresh**
- SwipeRefresh integration allows users to manually refresh feed
- Pull down to trigger `MemeRepository.fetchMemes()` again
- Useful for checking new posts without leaving feed

## ðŸŽ¯ Suggested Additional Improvements

### High Priority (Easy to Implement)

#### 1. **Infinite Scroll / Pagination**
- Load older memes as user scrolls to bottom of feed
- Add `LazyColumn` item callback to detect when near end
- Extend `since` filter in MemeRepository to fetch older notes
- Benefits: Better performance, smoother scrolling experience

#### 2. **Engagement Metrics**
- Display reaction/like counts from kind 7 (reactions) events
- Show reply counts by listening to kind 1 notes replying to this note
- Display zap/payment events (kind 9734/9735)
- Benefits: Shows popularity, encourages engagement

#### 3. **User Verification Badge**
- Show checkmark (âœ“) next to NIP-05 verified users
- Display in user info row next to name
- Use `userMetadata.nip05` field when available
- Benefits: Trust signal, identifies known accounts

#### 4. **Timestamp Display**
- Show relative time: "2 minutes ago", "1 hour ago", "3 days ago"
- Add helper to convert `createdAt` Unix timestamp
- Place below or next to username
- Benefits: Context for freshness of posts

#### 5. **Search/Filter**
- Add search bar to filter by hashtags
- Allow filter by creator name
- Store search history locally
- Benefits: Content discovery, better UX

### Medium Priority (More Complex)

#### 6. **Infinite Scroll with Pagination**
```kotlin
// Extend MemeRepository:
private var earliestTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000
fun loadOlderMemes() {
    val filter = JSONObject().apply {
        put("kinds", JSONArray().put(1))
        put("#t", JSONArray().apply { memeTags.forEach { put(it) } })
        put("until", earliestTimestamp - 1)
        put("limit", 20)
    }
    // Broadcast and load more
}
```

#### 7. **Interactive Reactions**
- Add heart/thumbs up button on each card
- Send kind 7 reaction event to Nostr
- Show local reaction state optimistically
- Sync with Amber signer if available
- Benefits: Engagement, social features

#### 8. **Meme Details Screen**
- Tap card to see full view with comments/reactions
- Navigate to detail screen with meme ID

#### 9. **Trending/Discover Tab**
- Calculate trending hashtags from last 24 hours
- Show top creators by activity
